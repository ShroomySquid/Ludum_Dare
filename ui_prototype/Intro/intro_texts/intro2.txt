YOUR SERVANTS

Your cultists can be assigned simple tasks that will help you manage
your ressources, like working to earn money, assisting with the ritual
or sent out to recruit more to the cause. You can also sacrifice them
for extra magic, just like prisoners. Be careful, as this may decrease
their loyalty to you and will reduce your total number of available cultits.

ARCHONS

You have 5 archons to assist you, all with their own unique 
expertise, learn how to use them to your advantage. Each
of them will have events that consist of tasks for them to complete.
