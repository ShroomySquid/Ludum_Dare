EVENTS

Every so often, your archons will have events. You will be given
a set of options on how to deal with the task that was brought
to you.

DAILY SUMMONS

Once per day, you will unlock a special event that
will allow you to use a special summon. This summon
can confer a new servant, a new powerful artifact or
grant you a magical effect that will help you on your
quest.
