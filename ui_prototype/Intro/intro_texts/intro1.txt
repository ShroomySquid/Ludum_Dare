, an old god cast into the void millenias ago 
because you kinda tried to turn the world into an octopus soup. But lately, 
the stars have aligned and your followers have managed to start an 
invocation ritual to summon you back into the world of the mortals. 
In exacly 1 week, the solar ecplise will allow you to be put back into our world,
but your followers first have to funnul sufficiant deadrical power into 
the ritual to give you a strong enough form to dominate the world.
