You are <player_name>, an old god cast into the void millenias ago because you kinda tried to turn the world into an octopus soup. But lately, the stars have aligned and your followers have managed to start an invocation ritual to summon you back into the world of mortals. In exacly 1 week, the solar ecplise will allow you to be put back into our world, but your followers first have to funnul sufficiant deadrical power into the ritual to give you a strong enough form to dominate the world.

OBJECTIVE:

You have to accumulate as much magic as possible before the counter ends. The ritual needs cultist to keep its funneled magic, the cultists needs money to live and needs to keep their moral high and you need to keep the magic high to keep the cultists moral.
